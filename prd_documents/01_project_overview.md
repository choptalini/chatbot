# Project Overview: SwiftReplies.ai Multi-Tenant Database Migration

## Executive Summary

SwiftReplies.ai is evolving from a single-tenant WhatsApp automation prototype to a fully-featured multi-tenant SaaS platform. This project focuses on migrating the existing PostgreSQL database schema to support multiple users, custom subscriptions, advanced features, and enterprise-level functionality.

## Business Context

### Current State
- Single WhatsApp bot serving one user/business
- Basic message handling and order tracking
- Simple campaign management
- No user isolation or subscription management

### Target State
- Multi-tenant SaaS platform supporting unlimited users
- Custom subscription plans with granular feature control
- Multiple chatbots per user account
- Human-in-the-loop Actions Center for complex decisions
- Advanced analytics and usage tracking
- API access and webhook integrations

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Enable Multi-Tenancy**: Support multiple users with complete data isolation
2. **Custom Subscriptions**: Flexible subscription model with custom features and limits
3. **Feature Scalability**: Database structure to support all planned SaaS features
4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing WhatsApp automation functionality
5. **Performance**: Ensure optimal database performance at scale

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Analytics Foundation**: Comprehensive usage tracking and analytics
2. **Enterprise Features**: Support for advanced features like Actions Center
3. **Integration Ready**: API keys, webhooks, and external integrations
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of user actions and system events

## Feature Requirements

- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, profile management
- **Subscription Management**: Custom plans with usage limits and feature flags
- **Multi-Chatbot Support**: Multiple WhatsApp bots per user account
- **Contact Isolation**: User-specific contact management with data separation
- **Message Tracking**: Enhanced message logging with tenant isolation

### Tier 2: Advanced SaaS Features
- **Actions Center**: Human-in-the-loop approval workflows
- **Usage Tracking**: Daily/monthly limits with overage monitoring
- **Analytics Dashboard**: KPI tracking and performance metrics
- **Campaign Enhancement**: Advanced targeting and delivery tracking
- **Order Management**: Enhanced e-commerce capabilities

### Tier 3: Enterprise Features
- **API Access**: REST API with authentication and rate limiting
- **Webhooks**: Event-driven integrations with external systems
- **Advanced Analytics**: Custom reports and data exports
- **Team Management**: Multiple users per account (future consideration)

## Technical Requirements

### Database Constraints
- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation between tenant data
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms query response times
- **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ users and 1M+ messages/day
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with backup and recovery procedures

### Subscription Model Requirements
- **Flexible Configuration**: JSONB-based feature flags and limits
- **Usage Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of message and campaign usage
- **Overage Handling**: Graceful handling of limit exceeded scenarios
- **Custom Billing**: Support for non-standard pricing models

### Integration Requirements
- **Supabase Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Frontend Integration**: Support for Next.js with real-time updates
- **Backend Compatibility**: Minimal changes to existing WhatsApp automation
- **Migration Safety**: Zero-downtime migration with rollback capabilities

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- [ ] Existing WhatsApp automation works without modification
- [ ] Admin user can access all features with unlimited usage
- [ ] New schema supports all planned SaaS features
- [ ] Data integrity maintained throughout migration

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Database queries maintain sub-100ms response times
- [ ] Support for concurrent multi-tenant operations
- [ ] Efficient storage with proper indexing

### Business Metrics
- [ ] Ready for customer onboarding within 1 week of migration

- [ ] Scalable architecture for 100+ simultaneous users

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Migration**: Risk of data loss during tenant assignment
2. **Constraint Changes**: Potential conflicts with existing unique constraints
3. **Backend Compatibility**: Breaking existing WhatsApp automation
4. **Performance Impact**: Query performance degradation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test each phase with production-like data
2. **Rollback Procedures**: Detailed rollback plans for each migration step
3. **Staged Deployment**: Implement changes in isolated phases
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring during migration

## Stakeholder Requirements

### Development Team
- Clear migration procedures with step-by-step instructions
- Comprehensive testing protocols
- Documentation for new schema structure

### Business Team
- Zero disruption to current operations
- Ready for customer demos and onboarding
- Support for flexible pricing models

### End Users (Future Customers)
- Reliable service with 99.9% uptime
- Fast response times (<2 seconds for message processing)
- Intuitive interface matching new database capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Complete detailed technical analysis of current schema
2. Design target architecture with all required tables
3. Create detailed migration plan with rollback procedures
4. Implement migration in staged phases
5. Validate functionality and performance
6. Deploy and monitor production migration
