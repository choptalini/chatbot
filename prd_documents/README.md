# SwiftReplies.ai Database Migration Project

## Overview
This folder contains all the Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and technical specifications for migrating the current single-tenant WhatsApp automation system to a fully multi-tenant SaaS platform.

## Project Scope
Transform the existing database schema to support:
- Multi-tenant architecture with user isolation
- Custom subscription management with granular feature control
- Multiple chatbots per user
- Human-in-the-loop Actions Center
- Advanced analytics and usage tracking
- Enhanced campaign management
- API access and webhooks

## Documentation Structure

### Planning Documents
- `01_project_overview.md` - High-level project goals and requirements
- `02_current_state_analysis.md` - Analysis of existing schema and limitations
- `03_target_architecture.md` - Detailed target schema design
- `04_migration_strategy.md` - Step-by-step migration plan

### Implementation Phases
- `phase1_new_core_tables.md` - Users, subscriptions, chatbots setup
- `phase2_existing_table_modifications.md` - Adding multi-tenancy to current tables
- `phase3_admin_user_setup.md` - Creating default admin user and chatbot
- `phase4_data_migration.md` - Migrating existing data safely
- `phase5_constraints_update.md` - Updating unique constraints for multi-tenancy
- `phase6_supporting_tables.md` - Analytics, usage tracking, and advanced features
- `phase7_performance_optimization.md` - Indexes and query optimization
- `phase8_testing_validation.md` - Testing strategy and validation procedures

### SQL Scripts
- `migration_scripts/` - All SQL migration scripts organized by phase
- `rollback_scripts/` - Rollback procedures for each phase
- `test_data/` - Sample data for testing

### Risk Management
- `risks_and_mitigation.md` - Identified risks and mitigation strategies
- `rollback_procedures.md` - Emergency rollback procedures
- `compatibility_matrix.md` - Backend compatibility requirements

## Timeline
**Estimated Duration**: 4-7 days
- Planning and Documentation: 1 day
- Schema Migration: 2-3 days  
- Backend Updates: 1-2 days
- Testing and Validation: 1-2 days

## Success Criteria
1. All existing WhatsApp functionality continues working
2. New multi-tenant schema supports planned SaaS features
3. Admin user can access unlimited functionality for testing
4. Database performance remains optimal
5. Data integrity maintained throughout migration

## Getting Started
1. Review `01_project_overview.md` for context
2. Follow implementation phases in order
3. Run tests after each phase
4. Validate with existing backend before proceeding
